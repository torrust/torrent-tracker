# BitTorrent Tracker Client

A library to interact with BitTorrent trackers.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is actively under development. We’re currently extracting and refining common types from the[Torrust Tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker) to make them available to the BitTorrent community in Rust. While these types are functional, they are not yet ready for use in production or third-party projects.
